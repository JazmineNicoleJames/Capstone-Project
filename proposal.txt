1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve?

- The goal of my website is for users to be able to create an account using their 
first name, birthdate, a username, and a password. Once logged in, they can begin 
a modified version of the word game Wordle. This version of Wordle will allow a user to 
have an opportunity to either select from a list of topics/themes, play a randomly selected 
topic/theme, or remove the filter completely to play a general word game. Once the START button 
is clicked, the timer will begin and the user will get 5 chances to solve a 5 letter word.
When a corect letter is in the correct spot, it will stay shown letter side up and turn a 
different color(possiblly green). If the letter is in the word, but in a different spot, it 
will also stay letter side up, but be a different color(possibly red). Once the user has exhausted 
all 5 guesses, the word along with the definition will be shown. 


2. What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?

- This game can be for all people. I will be programming it so the "offensive" 
boolean is False as to not allow innapropriate words. But possibly create
an "Adult" setting that will only be an option if your 18+.


3. What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet,
which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain.

- I plan on using the Merriam-Webster API. The "id" for the word, "syns" to access synonyms, 
"offensive" to toggle offensive words on/off, "shortdef" for the definition.


4. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not
know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer
questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:

a. What does your database schema look like?
- User table - id:__, name:__, birthdate:__, username:__, password:__, 
- Word table - word:__, synonym:__, definition:__, 
- Game table - score:__, timer:__, word:__, attempts:__, guessed_letters_greeen:__, guessed_letters_red:__,     
- Score table - top_score:__, fastest_time:__, 

b. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?
- Filtering words

c. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?

d. What functionality will your app include?
- Creating an account, generating 5 letter words, displaying the definintion,
tracking points, length of game, games won, fastest days, saving favorite topics/themes.

e. What will the user flow look like?
- Creating an account of logging in, clicking on START to begin, having 5 cahnces to guess a 5 letter word, 
have the option to save the theme, and/or begin another game.

f. What features make your site more than CRUD? Do you have any stretch
goals?
- A stretch goal for me is the feature to allow the user to pick theme words.
